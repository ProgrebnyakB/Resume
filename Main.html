        I met this beautiful woman who seemed shy. We somehow got to her apartment and started making out. We were gonna make love, but as we were kissing I blacked out. When I woke up from the blackout she was gone, and I had no clue what had just happened. My guard had become disabled, and it felt like I was taken advantage of. It seemed like there was no reason for her to leave, but I found out she had taken a flight out of the city we were in which was Shanghai. Confused I went outside to gather my bearings and I came out to this loading dock. There were a few people just meandering about doing their business. For some reason I decided to ask what was going on and explained what had just happened to a man unloading from his black Mercedes. He told me it was probably a tik-tok influencer looking for clout, and she used me to gain that in some way. After hearing that I decided to find my way home, but it seemed impossible. I was in one of the biggest cities trying to find my way home. As I was looking around to find which way to go I woke up to the sound of a snow plow or something scaping concrete outside(4:52am). On a side note I remember right before I had blacked out her facial features had changed as we both looked each other in the eyes. She was still beautiful, but it felt like she was hiding her true self from me.(This had happened to me before when I took acid once with Abby and had a bad trip) In my heart it felt like she wanted it, but ahe couldn't get over her own barriers. The look in her eyes was the dead giveaway. She had used a stupid excuse like tik tok to hide that, and it felt like I could see through her. These nightmares don't hurt or cause pain for me, but they do bring out my inner childs abandonment fears. It makes me feel like I am standing in the eye of a hurricane that doesn't move, but there is an infinite storm surging constantly around me.
